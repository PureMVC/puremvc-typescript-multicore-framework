/**
 * A Base `Notifier` implementation.
 *
 * `MacroCommand, Command, Mediator` and `Proxy`
 * all have a need to send `Notifications`.
 *
 * The `Notifier` interface provides a common method called
 * `sendNotification` that relieves implementation code of
 * the necessity to actually construct `Notifications`.
 *
 * The `Notifier` class, which all the above-mentioned classes
 * extend, provides an initialized reference to the `Facade`
 * Multiton, which is required for the convenience method
 * for sending `Notifications`, but also eases implementation as these
 * classes have frequent `Facade` interactions and usually require
 * access to the facade anyway.
 *
 * NOTE: In the MultiCore version of the framework, there is one caveat to
 * notifiers, they cannot send notifications or reach the facade until they
 * have a valid multitonKey.
 *
 * The multitonKey is set:
 *   - on a Command when it is executed by the Controller
 *   - on a Mediator is registered with the View
 *   - on a Proxy is registered with the Model.
 *
 * @see {@link Proxy}
 * @see {@link Facade}
 * @see {@link Mediator}
 * @see {@link MacroCommand}
 * @see {@link SimpleCommand}
 *
 * @class Notifier
